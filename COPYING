TinyMUSH 3 is a derivation of TinyMUSH 2.2 and TinyMUX, both of which are
derivations of TinyMUSH 2.0, which in turn is based upon TinyMUD. There are
also portions of source code derived from PennMUSH 1.50.

The TinyMUD copyright follows below. PennMUSH, TinyMUSH 2.0, TinyMUSH 2.2,
and TinyMUSH 3 follow the OSI-standard Artistic License.

Artistic License 2.0
--------------------

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package
may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is
that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the
development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as
open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package,
you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing
arrangement.

Definitions
-----------

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to
the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may 
consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible
to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others
outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not
mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has
been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration
files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the
Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution
--------------------------------------------------------

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified 
    Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not 
    Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version
------------------------------------------------------

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard
    Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis
    or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
    copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such
    verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications
    made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still
    be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the
    Original License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
----------------------------------------------------------

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for
    a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified
    Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the 
    Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any 
    non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do
    at least ONE of the following:

 (a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the 
     Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright
     Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

 (b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
     user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the 
     Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the
     Standard Version.

 (c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
     Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

  (i) the Original License or

  (ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
       redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that 
       apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the 
       Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it,
       be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
       Fees are allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the
    Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the
    Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the 
    time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you
    are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
    instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
    instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become 
    aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of
    your rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
    Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source
    of the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package
----------------------------------

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
    Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
    provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor
    Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the
    aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and
    Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the
    aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
    works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
    stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
    Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the 
    result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
--------------------------------------------------------

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely
    extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the 
    Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not 
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
    terms of this license. General Provisions

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
     Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
     distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify,
     or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made
     by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that
     your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
     mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge
     patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and
     otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims
     licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the
     Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or
     counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes
     direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License
     to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER
     AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. 
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR
     CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE,
     EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
