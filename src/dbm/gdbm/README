LibTinyGDBM version 3.3 is the first public release of the library and the
first releases of these files as part of LibTinyGDBM. Older revisions
are to be considered as part of the modified GDBM software previously used
by TinyMUSH (Previously call TinyMUSH-GDBM).

LibTinyGDBM is originally based on GDBM, the GNU database manager, by 
Philip A. Nelson Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1993  Free Software Foundation,
Inc. More information and original code can be downloaded from the GNU
website at the following URL:

Since GDBM has been modified over the years to better suit the needs of
TinyMUSH, the logical conclusion was to span the work into a new independent
library to avoid confusion with the original work. TinyMUSH's modified
version of GDBM can be downloaded at the following URL:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinymush/files/TinyMUSH/TinyMUSH-GDBM/

LibTinyGDBM is released under the GPL v2 license, see COPYING for more
information.

To compile the standalone version of LibTinyGDBM, use the usual way:

./configure
make
make install

This will install headers and libraries in the default location of your
system. Normally, there is no need to build the standalone version since the
game engine build mechanism include the needed steps to build and install
the package.

LibTinyGDBM is not design to be use as a replacement for GDBM, it is a
customised strip down version of the original GDBM work to suits TinyMUSH's 
needs. Compatibility with the former is not a goal of this project.
