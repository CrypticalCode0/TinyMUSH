Installation Instructions
=========================

TinyMUSH now use the CMAKE build system, which is alot easier to maintain
than Autotools. To make things even simpler, a build script is included.

Make sure you have the following libraries on your system:
    libcrypt-dev
    libgdbm-dev
    libnsl-dev
    libpcre3-dev
    libssl-dev

You will also need the build tools for your system and CMAKE.

For a clean install, simply run 'install.sh' which will build everything
for you. You can then change to the game directory and start 'netmush'

Default port is '6250' and default God's password is 'Potrzebie'.

The structure of TinyMUSH has changed again, here's the new directory
